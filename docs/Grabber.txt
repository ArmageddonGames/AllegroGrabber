The ZC DATAFILES (*.dat) are small database files that contain
a variety of data formats. 

To inspect, edit, or create these, you MUST use the Allegro
Grabber utility. 

The utility itself is easy enough to understand, however, some
of the .dat file are encrypted: longtan

Grabber uses Allegro 4.2, so, on newer Windows systems it will
exhibit the Alt+Tab bug that ZC (prior to 2.53.0) exhibited.

I'm not going to go through the hassle of updating it to
Allegro 4.4.3, to correct this.  -Z
